    <!--On line 10, there is a missing p in the closing paragraph brackets. I added the p-->
    <p>This page will explain differences between milk, dark, and Ruby chocolate.</p>
    <h2>Milk</h2>
    <p>Milk chocolate is solid chocolate made with either liquid milk, powdered milk, or condensed milk. </p>
    <h2>Dark</h2>
    <p>Unlike milk chocolate, dark chocolate contains no milk in it, instead using more cocoa, giving it a darker color and making it more bitter.</p>
    <h2>Ruby</h2>
    <!--on line 16, there is a dot in the place of a missing angle bracket which I added to  make the code right.--> 
    <p>Ruby chocolate is made from a different cocoa bean altogether. It is made from the ruby cocoa bean, which has a red color and different flavor.</p>
